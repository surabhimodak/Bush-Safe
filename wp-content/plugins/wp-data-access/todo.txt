*** BUGS ***

+ After updating a table design the user (sometimes) has to reconcile to reflect the real database table structure
+ Recreate repository not working as expected on WordPress multisite
+ Cannot not use Screen Options for child tables when having more than one child tabs
+ Data Project pages not editable when a remote host is down (solution: use ajax to fill listboxes; does this apply to other plugin pages as well?)
+ When you perform a reconcile, your lookup database/table combinations are messed up (Amy)
+ After adding new parent the child tab is not directly shown (Sebastian)
+ Hyperlinks Behaviour – Unexpected behaviour in Data Projects (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hyperlinks-behaviour-unexpected-behaviour-in-data-projects/)
+ Fix Data Backups
+ Shortcode wpdadiehard:
  The date format: in Wordpress my date format is d.m.Y. When i use this to enter date data, in first attempt the date will be turned around; when i correct it,
  in the second attempt it is correct. By now i have solved it by using the format YYYY-mm-dd to enter data but i would prefer to use the other format. (Barbara)
+ Project tables and dynamic hyperlinks gone after plugin update (multi site - Andrew)

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

+ Priority
  + In data Explorer, Manage, search columns, you cannot enable search check box if the column name has a space in it. The update does not change anything. (Charles)
    + Earlier I reported that Data Explorer->Manage->settings->search settings hung if there was a space in the column name.
      Today we learned that the same thing happens if there is a ’-‘ in the table name. For example catalogue-1r2 failed/hung but a rename to catalogue_1r2 worked just fine.
